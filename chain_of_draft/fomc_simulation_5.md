1. Option 1: Rate Cut by 0.25%
   - With a 50% probability, this option aligns with easing price pressures as inflation rates are slightly below target and to potentially further stimulate the economy by lowering borrowing costs.

2. Option 2: Rate Hold at Current Level
   - With a 30% probability, this option would maintain the current interest rates given the stable unemployment rate, implying strength in the labor market and an acceptable balance between stimulation and stability.

3. Option 3: Rate Cut by 0.50%
   - Less common but possible, with the stance of increasing economic resilience by further easing financial conditions, especially considering the accelerating GDP growth which indicates economic robustness.

These options reflect a balanced consideration of economic indicators and the implied probabilities of rate movements."
