Member point: Solution 2; disagreement; maintaining rates may hinder necessary growth in the current environment.  
Member point: Solution 3; disagreement; aggressive cuts could lead to long-term inflation issues that we must avoid.  

Position clarification: Solution 1; rationale: It balances growth stimulation with inflation control, crucial for current economic conditions.  
Position clarification: Solution 2; rationale: While stability is important, we cannot afford to miss growth opportunities.  
Position clarification: Solution 3; rationale: The risks of overheating the economy outweigh the short-term benefits of aggressive cuts.  

Policy factors: Inflation control; implication: We must prioritize measures that prevent runaway inflation while supporting growth.  
Policy factors: Employment stability; implication: Any rate decision must consider potential impacts on job markets.  
Policy factors: Regional growth; implication: Policies should support local economies, especially in tight labor markets.  

Updated leaning: Solution 1; rationale: It offers a balanced approach to stimulate growth without significant inflation risks.  
Updated leaning: Solution 2; rationale: While stability is appealing, we need to act to support economic momentum.  
Updated leaning: Solution 3; rationale: Aggressive cuts are too risky given current inflationary pressures.  

Updated 2025 prediction: Rate at 2.75%; reasoning based on expected stabilization of inflation and gradual economic recovery.  
Updated 2025 prediction: Rate at 3.0%; reasoning reflects cautious optimism about growth and inflation management.  
Updated 2025 prediction: Rate at 3.25%; reasoning considers potential inflation resurgence necessitating further adjustments."
