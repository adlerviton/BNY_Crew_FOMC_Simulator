Option 1: Maintain the current Federal Funds rate. Given the stable GDP growth of 2.1%, easing inflation rate of 3.5%, and a rising unemployment rate of 4.0%, the market's probability for maintaining the rate is 50%.

Option 2: Implement a 0.25% rate cut. With a moderate chance of easing (20%) due to decreasing inflation and potential signs of economic slowing indicated by the rising unemployment rate, a rate cut can provide stimulus.

Option 3: Implement a 0.25% rate hike. Although the probability of a rate hike is at 30%, this option remains viable if inflation risks unexpectedly resurface or stronger economic data emerges to counteract the slowing signs."

           2. Combine into single JSON object
           
           Steps:
           "Historical data: [extract]"
           "Metrics data: [extract]"
           "Votes data: [extract]"
           "Predictions data: [extract]"
           "Combined JSON: structure all together"
           
           Format exactly as:
