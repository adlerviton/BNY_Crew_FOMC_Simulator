The options for changing the rate should be in increments of 0.25% and all 3 options should be unique. You should pay particular attention to the implied rate hike probabilities and implied rate cut probabilities. You should never favor a solution, do not provide any advice for which option is best, and never describe any preliminary leanings. Do not give options that have a 0 percent implied probability.
